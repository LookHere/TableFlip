# TableFlip

Due to the supply chain challenges and the hurdles with e-recycling, we're developing project “Table Flip”, and automated way to deconstruct your stuff. 

The basic idea was that you’d load a part, flip the entire system over, it would unscrew every screw it found, and the pieces would fall into a bin below it. We [pitched it](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JYvzk7LvkOCaGtTT5c2umXrMO-kpudiZDgVEw_TJd9w/edit?usp=sharing) to our peers and got some great feedback.

You can [watch our development process](https://forums.balena.io/t/the-de-screwer-e-recycling-at-home-to-get-your-parts-back/357744) and download our files from the repositories.
