# TableFlip

Due to the supply chain challenges and the hurdles with e-recycling, we're developing project “Table Flip”, and automated way to deconstruct your stuff. 

Our first prototype would let you load a part, flip the entire system over, it would unscrew every screw it found, and the pieces would fall into a bin below it. We [pitched it](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JYvzk7LvkOCaGtTT5c2umXrMO-kpudiZDgVEw_TJd9w/edit?usp=sharing) to our peers and got some great feedback.

After demoing the first prototype, we came back together to see if we could simplify the process even further.  For our next prototype we decided:
- to modify a 3d printer, instead of building something new from scratch
- to build a mount for a usb soldering iron or soldering gun to de-solder (instead of de-screw) components 
- to de-soldering a perma-proto breadboard (not a circuit board) which will be more useful to more hardware hackers and easier for our machine learning algorithim to identify solder blobs
