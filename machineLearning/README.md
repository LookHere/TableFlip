# Machine Learning

The machine learning component of this project recognizes different types of screw heads on a PCB and selects the correct tool to remove them.


### To do: 

This section is still a work in progress. It currently contains two different models for recognizing image data and detecting screws. Currently, these models are very general. Eventually, we would like to create models that will recognize specific screw heads.
